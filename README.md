# DungeonBattleSimulator

Originally was the Final Project for CSCD349, but had been modified to include
more features beyond the scope of the assignment.

Future Planned Features:
- Gauntlet Mode: Create a team of 10 heros to enter 50 back to back battles, in which are increasing difficult.
- Custom Heros: The ability to create a custom hero, and to be able to save/load these heros.
- GUI: Move the game from being text-command based, to having a window and buttons.
